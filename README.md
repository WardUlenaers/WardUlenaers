## Hobbies

In addition to programming, I have diverse interests that enrich my life. Music has been and continues to be a significant passion. I dedicated seven years to music school, with a focus on piano for five of them.
Joining a [choir](https://rejoice.be/) ignited my interest in percussion, leading me to become a member of two bands: "[Spiegelei inC.](https://www.spiegelei-inc.be/)" and "[Hummingbird](https://vi.be/platform/hummingbird)".
Performing in these bands inspired both my dad and me to create a new percussion instrument called the [Cahang](https://www.cahang.be). This innovative instrument enables percussionists to wear it and move freely during performances, enhancing the dynamic and interactive elements of live music performances.

Additionally, I enjoy experimenting with sound mixing and recording, particularly in the realm of live events. You can find an example of my work on this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtgMQzvRadvFS0xXS9LG-mcf0plwh3b_g&si=u_s4wtSCAM4SKke8).
